    <h1>Welcome to the Music Band Manager</h1>
    <p>Semester project : Java EE, Spring based web application for the
        <a href="https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2017/PA165">[PA165]</a> course.</p>

    <h3>Project description</h3>
    <p>The web application allows one music band to manage their activities. Managers can create a new band and
        start hiring team members from a catalogue. They can set for the band the musical style (e.g. rock, pop,
        etcâ€¦), a name, and a logo. Band managers can add new albums and songs to a band. Each Song has a name and a
        duration. Managers can also schedule tours for the bands, in terms of dates and cities visited.</p>
    <p>Team members can login to the system and see the offers made by the band managers. They can accept or reject
        to be part of a band. After they are part of a band, they can see all the activities that are planned and
        the profiles of the other band members.</p>
